# QueueUsingWithStack
Swift Data Structure and Algorithm  with Swift 



/*
 First-in first-out queue (FIFO)
 
 New elements are added to the end of the queue. Dequeuing pulls elements from
 the front of the queue.



A queue can be implemented using two stacks. Let queue to be implemented be q and stacks used to implement q be stack1 and stack2.
